  <p>I am a problem-solver.  My personal motto is:  How can I help?  
      My experience in accounting and finance has allowed me to learn a broad
       variety of industries, organizations, and skills.  I am grateful for 
       the opportunity to work with a diverse group of people, to share 
       differing viewpoints, and to collaborate for the benefit of all.</p>
      <p>I am interested in a new challenge.  I want to join a dynamic 
        technology company.   I want to be on the team that is building the 
        future of sales, the future of work, the future for society.  I am 
        motivated, detailed, and results-oriented, and by using my excellent 
        planning, organization, project management, communication, and 
        technical skills, I want to contribute.</p>
      <p>My primary career objective is to lead with empathy.  I want to 
        achieve the goals of my organization, to support the growth of my 
        teammates and clients, and to add value in the areas of accounting, 
        finance, human resources, operations, data and analytics.

      <p>In addition, I am a single mother of two teenagers, ages 18 and 15.  
       My personal interests include movies and documentaries, especially
      related to history, politics, and economic policy.  </p>
      <p>I love solving
      puzzles of all kinds, including little cardboard pieces that make
      pretty pictures.  I enjoy reading books, fiction and non-fiction, and 
      taking care of my plants and flowers.</p>
      <p>This moment in history has made us all aware of our precarious position
        on this planet.  More importantly, the pandemic has exposed the inequalities
        among the people who live here.  I am dedicated to promoting the truth,
        the facts, and staying educated on the issues that will affect the future
        that my children are inheriting.</p>
      <p>I vow to speak out against injustice and to speak up on racial discrimination,
        gender, age and sexual orientation bias among colleagues and friends.  We must
        be educated and be able to confront difficult truth in order to behave as allies
        to our fellow citizens.
